Those arrested were among a small group of people who ran on to an M4 spur road and lay down in front of oncoming traffic, causing temporary disruption. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: \u201cThere have been 15 arrests for obstructing the highway and public order offences. Other campaigners gathered on the flyover to chant \u201cno ifs, no buts, no third runway\u201d and \u201cno more runways\u201d in the protest organised by the campaign group RisingUp! Placards reading \u201cHeathrow expansion will destroy thousands of homes\u201d and \u201cprotect the planet, no more runways\u201d, were also held high. A spokesman for the group said: \u201cThe government\u2019s decisions to expand Heathrow, despite mass opposition from local residents and the fact that doing so is incompatible with the UK\u2019s own laws on climate change, leaves us with no morally acceptable option but to resist. \u201cOnly 15% of the British public is responsible for 70% of international flights taken in the UK and Heathrow largely serves international passengers who have a mean income of \u00a357,000 per year.",

Thousands of people are reported to have gathered in the town of Harf Sufyan, near Huth, in a peaceful protest calling for political change and an end to corruption. A rebel spokesman told Reuters news agency that the military had fired rockets at protesters from an army base. The government and the Houthi rebels, members of the Zaidi Shia sect, have been observing a truce, although there are occasional clashes. The Houthi announced their support last month for anti-government protests which have been inspired by the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia.",

Among their desires was the announcement of election dates, along with the abolishment of military tribunals, the establishment of minimum and maximum wages and permission for Egyptians abroad to vote in the coming elections.",

They pleaded not guilty before Sessions Court Judge Nixion Kennedy Kumbong, who then fixed April 28 for pre-trial management. The accused were said to have received the cash between late last year and early this year. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) charged them separately under Section 165 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum imprisonment of two years, or a fine, or both upon conviction. The six \u2014 assistant enforcement officer Khairul Nizam Omar, 41, Immigration officers Norhaliza Hussein, 34, Emily Ngayan anak Beliang, 36, Benjamin Morsit, 34, Gracy Bohan, 35, and Agnes James Daim, 42 \u2014 were accused of accepting the cash from Fazal Illahi Juma Gul. MACC prosecuting officer Katherine Nais asked the court to release each of the six on RM10,000 cash with two sureties, but Roger Chin, defence counsel for Agnes and Emily, strongly objected to the cash bail. \u201cThere is no reason to impose the cash bail at all because there is no evidence to show that they will not attend the trial later,\u201d he said, adding that both Agnes and Emily are still working with the Immigration Department. He said when MACC called them last Friday to go to the court to face the charges, they came voluntarily before 9am today. The court also fixed bail for Norhaliza at RM6,000, Benjamin at RM5,000, Khairul Nizam at RM5,000 and Gracy at RM7,000.",

They pleaded not guilty before Sessions Court Judge Nixion Kennedy Kumbong, who then fixed April 28 for pre-trial management. The accused were said to have received the cash between late last year and early this year. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) charged them separately under Section 165 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum imprisonment of two years, or a fine, or both upon conviction. The six \u2014 assistant enforcement officer Khairul Nizam Omar, 41, Immigration officers Norhaliza Hussein, 34, Emily Ngayan anak Beliang, 36, Benjamin Morsit, 34, Gracy Bohan, 35, and Agnes James Daim, 42 \u2014 were accused of accepting the cash from Fazal Illahi Juma Gul. MACC prosecuting officer Katherine Nais asked the court to release each of the six on RM10,000 cash with two sureties, but Roger Chin, defence counsel for Agnes and Emily, strongly objected to the cash bail. \u201cThere is no reason to impose the cash bail at all because there is no evidence to show that they will not attend the trial later,\u201d he said, adding that both Agnes and Emily are still working with the Immigration Department. He said when MACC called them last Friday to go to the court to face the charges, they came voluntarily before 9am today. The judge then fixed RM6,000 court bail for Agnes and RM7,000 for Emily, both with one surety each.",

The Justice Ministry said the trial, which was due to have opened on March 17 with the reading of an indictment in three graft cases against Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, would begin on May 24 due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Charges against him include bribery, breach of trust and fraud. Netanyahu, 70, who is spearheading Israel\u2019s measures to slow the spread of the virus, has denied any wrongdoing. The prime minister was tested for the coronavirus as a precaution, his office said on Sunday. It did not announce the result but said he was asymptomatic before the test, which was also administered to those in his close proximity. Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, is fighting for his political life after an inconclusive election on March 2, following ballots in April and September that also ended without a clear victor. In his legal cases, Netanyahu is accused of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts from tycoons, which prosecutors say included cigars and champagne, and of dispensing regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website. He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.",

The Justice Ministry said the trial, which was due to have opened on March 17 with the reading of an indictment in three graft cases against Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, would begin on May 24 due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Charges against him include bribery, breach of trust and fraud. Netanyahu, 70, who is spearheading Israel\u2019s measures to slow the spread of the virus, has denied any wrongdoing. The prime minister was tested for the coronavirus as a precaution, his office said on Sunday. It did not announce the result but said he was asymptomatic before the test, which was also administered to those in his close proximity. Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, is fighting for his political life after an inconclusive election on March 2, following ballots in April and September that also ended without a clear victor. In his legal cases, Netanyahu is accused of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts from tycoons, which prosecutors say included cigars and champagne, and of dispensing regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website. He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.",

He and his supporters had pressured the country's long-term leader, Serzh Sargsyan, to step down rather than seek a power grab. After meeting with Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Pashinian on Monday vowed to \"give a new impetus\" to Armenia's relations with Russia and said \"no one has ever doubted\" that Russia is a strategic ally for his country.",

One of those arrested was Wing Commander Tony Winship, the former BAE executive who handled payments to Saudi dignitaries. Legal sources said the driver was not regarded as a central figure, but is helping in the investigation. The SFO said: \"We can confirm that as part of the ongoing investigation jointly undertaken by the SFO and the Ministry of Defence police into companies contracted by BAE to provide services in connection with defence equipment contracts with the government of Saudi Arabia , a 73-year-old man and a 65-year-old man attended Holborn police station by appointment.\" The significance of the SFO's fresh arrests is that they represent a completely new turn in the corruption investigation. Payments were signed off by top BAE executives. The SFO is currently compiling lengthy witness statements from those involved, with a view to putting the case before law officers by the end of this year.",

The company's CEO Maria das Gracas Foster and five other executive directors resigned Wednesday, amid what the Brazilian media call the biggest corporate scandal in the country's history. Petrobras' downward journey started in September when reports of its alleged wrongdoing first surfaced in the media. Dozens of senior managers of Petrobras and other companies have been arrested during the months long criminal investigation dubbed \"Operation Car Wash.\" Federal prosecutors accuse Petrobras' former executives of bribery and money laundering. The investigators say the managers illegally \"diverted\" billions from Petrobras' accounts for their activities. More than 80 people have been charged in connection with the scandal. Wolf Popper law firm, which represents Petrobras' shareholders in a class action lawsuit, said the oil company was also releasing false statements and misleading investors about its asset values. Petrobras ( PBRA ) stock has fallen 53% since September when the scandal first erupted. Its credit default swaps, indicating the risk investors attach to the company, soared over 200 basis points this year alone, and credit rating companies Fitch and Moody's downgraded it to junk. But when news of the corporate shake up emerged on Tuesday, Petrobras regained some value, rising 16%. Some say the resignations might give the oil giant a fresh start. This may be an opportunity for Petrobras to get back on track and move past the corruption controversy,\" said Gianna Bern, the author of Investing in Energy and former senior director at Fitch Ratings.",

Hundreds of young men, chanting slogans against corruption and high unemployment, tried to storm the local government offices in Sulaimaniya. An advisor to the Kurdish regional government, Tarek Jawhar, told the BBC that hundreds of young men marched towards the local offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of regional President Massoud Barzani. Witnesses said they were chanting: \"The corrupt must face justice.\" Police started shooting when some people tried to storm the building, resulting in the deaths of two young men, Iraqi officials said. Thursday's protest and a similar rally in Kut on Wednesday were Iraq's most violent since a wave of Arab revolts broke out last month that have toppled the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt.",

Khan, the leader of the Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI), had vowed to \u201clock down\u201d Pakistan\u2019s capital on Wednesday as part of his campaign against Nawaz Sharif after the leaking of the Panama Papers . He says the prime minister must explain how his children became owners or trustees of offshore companies that own expensive London property. With thousands of Khan\u2019s supporters bearing down on the capital on Tuesday, the supreme court offered a way out of the crisis, saying the PTI and the governing Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) had until Thursday to agree terms of reference for the judge-led inquiry or the court would decide them. Sharif and his children deny any wrongdoing, but Khan has suggested that the family\u2019s offshore companies may have been used to hide \u201cill-gotten wealth\u201d or avoid tax. Islamabad had been braced for the arrival of thousands of Khan\u2019s supporters, in a repeat of the PTI\u2019s 2014 street protests that lasted four months. Fearing violent confrontations in the heart of the capital, the government had taken extraordinary steps to head off the protests, including placing shipping containers across some of the access roads into Islamabad and using colonial-era legislation to ban gatherings of more than four people in Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s largest province.",

Sharif and his children deny any wrongdoing, but Khan has suggested that the family\u2019s offshore companies may have been used to hide \u201cill-gotten wealth\u201d or avoid tax.

He says the prime minister must explain how his children became owners or trustees of offshore companies that own expensive London property.

Sharif and his children deny any wrongdoing, but Khan has suggested that the family\u2019s offshore companies may have been used to hide \u201cill-gotten wealth\u201d or avoid tax.

The outbreak began in early November but was not confirmed as yellow fever until December 23 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Nathan Kenya-Mugisha, director general of the Ugandan Health Ministry, said Tuesday. \"We are doing all we can to contain the disease,\" Kenya-Mugisha said. \"We are working with our partners to mobilize our resources to vaccinate (in) the affected areas.\" Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted to human beings through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It can lead to severe hepatitis and hemorrhaging, according to the CDC. There is no specific treatment for yellow fever, and care is based on symptoms that include fever, backache, nausea and vomiting. People can pass on the illness without ever having its symptoms. The World Health Organization estimates there are 200,000 cases of yellow fever and 30,000 deaths worldwide each year. Uganda's last outbreak of yellow fever, a disease endemic to tropical regions, was in the early 1970s, Kenya-Mugisha said.",

Supporters of an extreme right party which entered Greece's parliament for the first time in the 6 May elections have clashed with police during an anti-immigrant protest in the western port of Patras. Riot police guarding the immigrants responded with teargas after they came under fire from stones thrown by supporters of the anti-immigrant group Golden Dawn, which held a separate march. Several suspected rioters were detained by police, according to the Associated Press news agency. The protests followed the fatal stabbing of a local man, allegedly by illegal Afghan migrants. Golden Dawn won 7% of the votes in the elections on a tide of anti-immigration sentiment after it campaigned using the slogan \"let's rid this country of the stench\". Its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, was among the party chiefs who held meetings with the Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, as attempts were made to form a coalition in order to avert new elections. Recent polls have shown falling support for Golden Dawn ahead of the new round of elections on 17 June, so it remains uncertain if the party will retain its seats.",

Supporters of an extreme right party which entered Greece's parliament for the first time in the 6 May elections have clashed with police during an anti-immigrant protest in the western port of Patras. The clashes followed a peaceful demonstration by hundreds of residents outside an old factory inhabited by migrants seeking to stow away on ferries bound for Italy, according to Greek authorities. Riot police guarding the immigrants responded with teargas after they came under fire from stones thrown by supporters of the anti-immigrant group Golden Dawn, which held a separate march. The protests followed the fatal stabbing of a local man, allegedly by illegal Afghan migrants.",

Singh, according to sources. Earlier on February 20, the CBI, on the complaint of ED registered a case against A.P. Singh and Moin Qureshi along with others. According to sources, it has been alleged that Qureshi was taking favour from public servants and money from various unknown sources. The investigating agency also conducted raids in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad and Chennai in connection with Qureshi's money laundering case. Earlier this year, a Look Out Circular (LOC) was issued by ED against Qureshi to ensure his presence during the probe in the money laundering case against him. However, on February 23, the former CBI chief came out defiantly against the allegation of being involved in a corruption case related to Qureshi, and said majority of chats between him and the former took place after his retirement. \"Majority chats (BBM chats with Meat exporter Moin Qureshi) are after I retired from the CBI in November 2012,\" said Singh to ANI. Singh further said the majority of the chats are personal and not something which can help in investigation. \"None of the purported BBMs pertain to the CBI investigations. They are mostly personal and innocuous in nature as between friends,\" he said. The Income tax and Enforcement Directorate (ED) have not added anything further,\" he added.",

On Tuesday Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each pledged $4 billion in aid to Egypt, where the army overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood's Mursi a week ago after huge street demonstrations against the elected president. The aid from the three Gulf Arab oil producers is expected to help Egypt avoid a balance of payments crisis and overcome fuel shortages that partly stoked public anger against Morsi. It will also ease pressure on Cairo to conclude long-running talks with the International Monetary Fund on a $4.8 billion loan. However, a surging fiscal gap and political turmoil following Morsi's toppling last week will remain a pressing challenge for Egyptian authorities, analysts said. Qatar lent Egypt more than $7 billion during Morsi's abruptly curtailed year in power, but other Gulf states remained aloof, wary of the Muslim Brotherhood's potential influence in their own conservative, dynastically ruled countries.",

Some 32 people were injured, including several police officers, and several dozen were arrested after police broke up the \"surround the parliament\" demonstration against Mariano Rajoy's government shortly after it overran its 9.30pm deadline. Several hundred protesters remained peacefully on the streets near the parliament building late on Tuesday night. They are demanding the resignation of the government and the king, as well as a rewrite of Spain's constitution. Authorities have estimated the number of protesters at 6,000 \u2013 relatively small by Spanish standards. Several key parts of the peaceful indignado protest movement, which successfully occupied city squares around Spain last year, had refused to support Tuesday's demonstration. Protesters complained that police officers hid badges so they could not be identified. \"They don't wear them and we back that when they deal with violent groups. Give them hell and that's it!\" tweeted Jose Manuel Sanchez, of the SUP police union. Tuesday's protests came shortly after Catalan regional prime minister Artur Mas called a snap election for 25 November amid a growing wave of support for separatism in Spain's wealthiest region.",

REUTERS - France\u2019s top court ruled on Friday that a trial of former president Jacques Chirac for the misuse of public funds must go ahead, rejecting an earlier move to drop the case. The long-awaited trial of Chirac and nine co-defendants marks the first time a former French head of state has been tried since 1945, when Marshal Philippe Petain was convicted of treason for collaborating with the Nazis during World War Two. The trial, which only opened after 11 years of legal wrangling, was postponed in March so that France\u2019s Court of Appeals could consider a complaint from a co-defendant that some of the alleged offences were too old to be tried under a statute of limitations. The delay triggered an outcry from anti-graft campaigners who feared Chirac would get special treatment as a former president. The 78-year-old, who ruled France for 12 years until 2007, is accused of using public money to pay for phantom jobs for political cronies while he was mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. A Paris court is now to decide on June 20 when the trial should resume, with a date in September considered as likely. Chirac, who remains one of France\u2019s most popular politicians, enjoyed immunity from prosecution during his two terms as president. If found guilty, Chirac could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and could be ordered to pay 150,000 euros ($215,000) in fines. However, a suspended sentence is considered more likely in the event of a conviction.",
