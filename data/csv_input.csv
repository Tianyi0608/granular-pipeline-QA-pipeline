"Sarawakian immigration officers charged with graft KUCHING, April 10 — Six immigration officers were charged here today with receiving bribes of between RM100 and RM1,000 to allegedly allow undocumented foreign workers into the state. They pleaded not guilty before Sessions Court Judge Nixion Kennedy Kumbong, who then fixed April 28 for pre-trial management. The accused were said to have received the cash between late last year and early this year. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) charged them separately under Section 165 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum imprisonment of two years, or a fine, or both upon conviction. The six — assistant enforcement officer Khairul Nizam Omar, 41, Immigration officers Norhaliza Hussein, 34, Emily Ngayan anak Beliang, 36, Benjamin Morsit, 34, Gracy Bohan, 35, and Agnes James Daim, 42 — were accused of accepting the cash from Fazal Illahi Juma Gul. MACC prosecuting officer Katherine Nais asked the court to release each of the six on RM10,000 cash with two sureties, but Roger Chin, defence counsel for Agnes and Emily, strongly objected to the cash bail. “There is no reason to impose the cash bail at all because there is no evidence to show that they will not attend the trial later,” he said, adding that both Agnes and Emily are still working with the Immigration Department. He said when MACC called them last Friday to go to the court to face the charges, they came voluntarily before 9am today. The court also fixed bail for Norhaliza at RM6,000, Benjamin at RM5,000, Khairul Nizam at RM5,000 and Gracy at RM7,000.",Where a corruption has taken place?,0

The accused were said to have received the cash between late last year and early this year. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) charged them separately under Section 165 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum imprisonment of two years, or a fine, or both upon conviction. The six — assistant enforcement officer Khairul Nizam Omar, 41, Immigration officers Norhaliza Hussein, 34, Emily Ngayan anak Beliang, 36, Benjamin Morsit, 34, Gracy Bohan, 35, and Agnes James Daim, 42 — were accused of accepting the cash from Fazal Illahi Juma Gul. MACC prosecuting officer Katherine Nais asked the court to release each of the six on RM10,000 cash with two sureties, but Roger Chin, defence counsel for Agnes and Emily, strongly objected to the cash bail. “There is no reason to impose the cash bail at all because there is no evidence to show that they will not attend the trial later,” he said, adding that both Agnes and Emily are still working with the Immigration Department. He said when MACC called them last Friday to go to the court to face the charges, they came voluntarily before 9am today. The court also fixed bail for Norhaliza at RM6,000, Benjamin at RM5,000, Khairul Nizam at RM5,000 and Gracy at RM7,000.",How long does someone be prisoned/sentenced?,0

They pleaded not guilty before Sessions Court Judge Nixion Kennedy Kumbong, who then fixed April 28 for pre-trial management. The accused were said to have received the cash between late last year and early this year. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) charged them separately under Section 165 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum imprisonment of two years, or a fine, or both upon conviction. The six — assistant enforcement officer Khairul Nizam Omar, 41, Immigration officers Norhaliza Hussein, 34, Emily Ngayan anak Beliang, 36, Benjamin Morsit, 34, Gracy Bohan, 35, and Agnes James Daim, 42 — were accused of accepting the cash from Fazal Illahi Juma Gul. MACC prosecuting officer Katherine Nais asked the court to release each of the six on RM10,000 cash with two sureties, but Roger Chin, defence counsel for Agnes and Emily, strongly objected to the cash bail. “There is no reason to impose the cash bail at all because there is no evidence to show that they will not attend the trial later,” he said, adding that both Agnes and Emily are still working with the Immigration Department. He said when MACC called them last Friday to go to the court to face the charges, they came voluntarily before 9am today.

"Coronavirus crisis delays start of Netanyahu corruption trial JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial was delayed on Sunday for two months, until May, due to the coronavirus crisis. The Justice Ministry said the trial, which was due to have opened on March 17 with the reading of an indictment in three graft cases against Israel’s longest-serving leader, would begin on May 24 due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Charges against him include bribery, breach of trust and fraud. Netanyahu, 70, who is spearheading Israel’s measures to slow the spread of the virus, has denied any wrongdoing. The prime minister was tested for the coronavirus as a precaution, his office said on Sunday. It did not announce the result but said he was asymptomatic before the test, which was also administered to those in his close proximity. Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, is fighting for his political life after an inconclusive election on March 2, following ballots in April and September that also ended without a clear victor. In his legal cases, Netanyahu is accused of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts from tycoons, which prosecutors say included cigars and champagne, and of dispensing regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website.

The company's CEO Maria das Gracas Foster and five other executive directors resigned Wednesday, amid what the Brazilian media call the biggest corporate scandal in the country's history. Petrobras' downward journey started in September when reports of its alleged wrongdoing first surfaced in the media. Dozens of senior managers of Petrobras and other companies have been arrested during the months long criminal investigation dubbed ""Operation Car Wash."" Federal prosecutors accuse Petrobras' former executives of bribery and money laundering. The investigators say the managers illegally ""diverted"" billions from Petrobras' accounts for their activities. More than 80 people have been charged in connection with the scandal. Wolf Popper law firm, which represents Petrobras' shareholders in a class action lawsuit, said the oil company was also releasing false statements and misleading investors about its asset values. Petrobras ( PBRA ) stock has fallen 53% since September when the scandal first erupted. Its credit default swaps, indicating the risk investors attach to the company, soared over 200 basis points this year alone, and credit rating companies Fitch and Moody's downgraded it to junk.

"Imran Khan abandons Islamabad protest after inquiry into PM granted Imran Khan has abandoned plans to bring Islamabad to a standstill after Pakistan’s highest court agreed to his petition to launch an inquiry into corruption allegations against the prime minister. Khan, the leader of the Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI), had vowed to “lock down” Pakistan’s capital on Wednesday as part of his campaign against Nawaz Sharif after the leaking of the Panama Papers . He says the prime minister must explain how his children became owners or trustees of offshore companies that own expensive London property. With thousands of Khan’s supporters bearing down on the capital on Tuesday, the supreme court offered a way out of the crisis, saying the PTI and the governing Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) had until Thursday to agree terms of reference for the judge-led inquiry or the court would decide them. Sharif and his children deny any wrongdoing, but Khan has suggested that the family’s offshore companies may have been used to hide “ill-gotten wealth” or avoid tax. Islamabad had been braced for the arrival of thousands of Khan’s supporters, in a repeat of the PTI’s 2014 street protests that lasted four months.

"Golden Dawn in clash with Greek police at anti-immigrant protest People run to avoid teargas during clashes between supporters of the far-right Golden Dawn and police after an anti-immigrant protest in the Greek port of Patras. Supporters of an extreme right party which entered Greece's parliament for the first time in the 6 May elections have clashed with police during an anti-immigrant protest in the western port of Patras. Riot police guarding the immigrants responded with teargas after they came under fire from stones thrown by supporters of the anti-immigrant group Golden Dawn, which held a separate march. Several suspected rioters were detained by police, according to the Associated Press news agency. The protests followed the fatal stabbing of a local man, allegedly by illegal Afghan migrants. Golden Dawn won 7% of the votes in the elections on a tide of anti-immigration sentiment after it campaigned using the slogan ""let's rid this country of the stench"". Its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, was among the party chiefs who held meetings with the Greek president, Karolos Papoulias, as attempts were made to form a coalition in order to avert new elections. Recent polls have shown falling support for Golden Dawn ahead of the new round of elections on 17 June, so it remains uncertain if the party will retain its seats.",What space/building is taken over in a protest?,0

"UAE agrees to give Egypt $3 billion in loans and grants Kuwait will provide $4 billion in aid to Egypt, state news agency KUNA said on Wednesday, matching pledges by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that showed Gulf Arab approval of the Egyptian army's ousting of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. On Tuesday Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each pledged $4 billion in aid to Egypt, where the army overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood's Mursi a week ago after huge street demonstrations against the elected president. The aid from the three Gulf Arab oil producers is expected to help Egypt avoid a balance of payments crisis and overcome fuel shortages that partly stoked public anger against Morsi. It will also ease pressure on Cairo to conclude long-running talks with the International Monetary Fund on a $4.8 billion loan. However, a surging fiscal gap and political turmoil following Morsi's toppling last week will remain a pressing challenge for Egyptian authorities, analysts said. Qatar lent Egypt more than $7 billion during Morsi's abruptly curtailed year in power, but other Gulf states remained aloof, wary of the Muslim Brotherhood's potential influence in their own conservative, dynastically ruled countries.",Who is arrested in a protest?,0

"Violence in Madrid as police charge protesters Violence flared on Tuesday in the centre of Madrid as baton-wielding police charged crowds and fired rubber bullets at demonstrators who had tried to surround the country's parliament building. Some 32 people were injured, including several police officers, and several dozen were arrested after police broke up the ""surround the parliament"" demonstration against Mariano Rajoy's government shortly after it overran its 9.30pm deadline. Several hundred protesters remained peacefully on the streets near the parliament building late on Tuesday night. They are demanding the resignation of the government and the king, as well as a rewrite of Spain's constitution. Authorities have estimated the number of protesters at 6,000 – relatively small by Spanish standards. Several key parts of the peaceful indignado protest movement, which successfully occupied city squares around Spain last year, had refused to support Tuesday's demonstration. Protesters complained that police officers hid badges so they could not be identified. ""They don't wear them and we back that when they deal with violent groups. Give them hell and that's it!"" tweeted Jose Manuel Sanchez, of the SUP police union. Tuesday's protests came shortly after Catalan regional prime minister Artur Mas called a snap election for 25 November amid a growing wave of support for separatism in Spain's wealthiest region.",Who is jailed/imprisoned in a protest?,0

"A French appeals court has ruled that former President Jacques Chirac’s corruption trial can go ahead after rejecting claims that some of the charges, which date back to the 1990s, are unconstitutional under the statute of limitations. REUTERS - France’s top court ruled on Friday that a trial of former president Jacques Chirac for the misuse of public funds must go ahead, rejecting an earlier move to drop the case. The long-awaited trial of Chirac and nine co-defendants marks the first time a former French head of state has been tried since 1945, when Marshal Philippe Petain was convicted of treason for collaborating with the Nazis during World War Two. The trial, which only opened after 11 years of legal wrangling, was postponed in March so that France’s Court of Appeals could consider a complaint from a co-defendant that some of the alleged offences were too old to be tried under a statute of limitations. The delay triggered an outcry from anti-graft campaigners who feared Chirac would get special treatment as a former president. The 78-year-old, who ruled France for 12 years until 2007, is accused of using public money to pay for phantom jobs for political cronies while he was mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. A Paris court is now to decide on June 20 when the trial should resume, with a date in September considered as likely. Chirac, who remains one of France’s most popular politicians, enjoyed immunity from prosecution during his two terms as president. If found guilty, Chirac could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and could be ordered to pay 150,000 euros ($215,000) in fines. However, a suspended sentence is considered more likely in the event of a conviction.",Where a corruption has taken place?,0
